Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack clusters are enterprise grade, highly available and scalable Redis clusters with substantially lower operational overhead than any other Redis deployment method.

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack extends open source Redis and delivers tangible benefits of stable high performance, zero-downtime linear scaling and hassle-free true high availability, with significant operational savings.

This documentation describes Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). 
Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. 
Developers can provision highly availabe and scalable Redis databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack is an enterprise-grade cluster that acts as a container for managing and running multiple Redis databases in a highly available and scalable manner.

The Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack Service Broker exposes four service plans on the Marketplace. The service plans correspond to the following preconfigured database plans:

* Simple Redis database: a single master shard.
* Highly-available Redis database: master/slave shards or master/multi-slave shards.
* Redis clustered database: multiple master shards.
* Highly-available Redis clustered database: multiple master shards each with its own slave shard, or multiple master/multi-slave shards.

For more specific information, see the [Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/overview/).
